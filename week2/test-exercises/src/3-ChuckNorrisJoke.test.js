/**
 * ChuckNorrisJoke is a component that fetches a joke from an api and displays it on the screen.
 * It is a simple component that we can use to practice API testing! Let's look at how the user sees the component:
 *
 * - When starting, the user should see a Loading... text
 * - Once the joke has been fetched it should be shown on the screen
 * - If there is an error, an error message needs to be showen to the user
 *
 * You don't want your component to really connect to the API when unit testing so you will want to mock that.
 * To make this easier, a package called `jest-fetch-mock` can be useful, you will have to set that up yourself.
 * Have a look at: https://github.com/jefflau/jest-fetch-mock
